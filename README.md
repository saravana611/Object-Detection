# Object-Detection on Images

  - YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm. In this notebook, we will apply the YOLO algorithm to detect objects in images, videos and webcam.

  - This project implements an image object detection classifier using pretrained yolov3 models. The yolov3 models are taken from the official yolov3 paper which was released in the year 2018.


## Note
To Run this project you need to download and move your YOLO weights into Data directory where Yolov3.cfg and Yolov3.txt  are present.

you can download the YOLOV3 Pre-trained Model Weights (yolov3.weights) (237 MB) [here](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights).
